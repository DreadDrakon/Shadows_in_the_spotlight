Important Things that need to be done: 

1. pick up item mechanic
2. levels(the player has to pick up a certain amount of reels before a door unlocks, allowing them to progress to the next level, whilst this is happening they have to avoid being caught by the cultist members as being caught will send reset your progress)
3. sound effects 
4. music
